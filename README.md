## About the Project

This repository is part of the **"Marketable IT Skills: Integrating Real-World Challenges into Vocational Education"** project. The project is supported by the **Erasmus+ programme** of the European Union. It is coordinated by the **HTTP Foundation** (Hungary) in cooperation with the partner institution **Helsinki Business College OY** (Finland). The primary goal of the project is to support IT vocational education by providing a collection of project tasks and a web application with an evaluation support system. These tasks aim to reflect labor market expectations, simulate real workplace challenges, and support talent management. The project's task collection draws upon competition materials of WorldSkills, EuroSkills and different national and international competition. The web application is being developed as part of the project activities.
